# Image Search Abstraction Layer
Checking live demo at: [Glitch](https://frankbearzou-image-search-abstraction-layer.glitch.me).

In order to search image, Google Customer Search API has been used in this project.

## User Stories
- I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
- I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
- I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
